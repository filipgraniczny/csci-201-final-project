# 201 Trip Tracker
The **201 trip tracker** project is to create a website that allows users to save all of their previous flights, hotel stays, excursions, and photos for future reference and to preserve memories. Users will be able to post and update trips they go on by adding images, links, descriptions, and other information about their vacations. We want this website to be a hub for avid travelers to share their experiences and potential vacationers who are looking for inspiration.

> This software serves as a final project for CSCI 201: Principles of Software Development at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu).
